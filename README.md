- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yuukiie, i'm 24 but you can also call me Marie, and i'm a french coding woman.
- 👀 I’m interested in web developing and would love to have the opportunity to learn with professionels while learning in school.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and i will start JavaScript soon. I prefer to make sure that i really understand how HTML and CSS work before moving forward.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on little projects, or anything that can help me increase my coding skills.
- 📫 You can reach me by Facebook under the name "Marie Chou".

Also, about me : i am a good listener, i am persistant and autonomous.
These are some of the most important soft-skills that i have that help me get through my learning coding process everyday.
Learning by myself isn't easy but it's definitely worth it when you finally achieve what you wanted to do, and that all by yourself.
This brings positivity. :)
